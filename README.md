# Steam Snap

This is a snap of Valve's [Steam client][1].  It is intended to run on any system that supports snapd, providing a consistent environment to
run the games separate from the underlying host operating system.

## Building locally

To build this snap locally, you need [Snapcraft][2].  The project can
be built with the following command:

    $ snapcraft --use-lxd
    
## Troubleshooting

**Terms**

__Native__: a *native* game is a game that runs on Linux *without any* compatability libraries like Proton. This generally means the game developer specifically built a version of the game for Linux systems and is usually the "best" form of the game.

[__Proton__][8]: Proton is a compatability layer, made by Valve, for Steam on Linux that emulates a Windows environment using tools like [Wine][9]. Proton allows Windows-exclusive games to run on Linux systems. You can force native games to use Proton instead, but generally native is better if available.

### What games can I play?

[Steam Deck verified games][4] are verified by Valve to work on the Steam Deck (Linux-based) and should work on desktop Linux distributions.

[ProtonDB][3] is a great resource for finding community information about specific games and their playability.

To filter your own library, go to your Steam Library tab and click the penguin ([Tux][7]) to show games that run on Linux. Alternatively, click the *advanced filtering options* button, expand the dropdown under *Hardware Support*, and choose a level of verification level of games to filter by.

### Steam Play / Proton

**Enable Proton Globally**  
`Steam > Settings > Steam Play`

Enabling Steam Play will automatically download Proton compatability libraries for non-native games.

'Enable Steam Play for supported titles' enables compatability tools for games verified by Valve to work well on Linux.

'Enable Steam Play for all other titles' enables compatability tools for *all* non-native games in your library. Unsupported titles greatly vary in functionality, check [ProtonDB][3] for more info on specific games.

**Enable Proton Individually**  
`Right click the game > Properties > Compatbility > Check 'Force the use of...' > Choose a Proton version`

*Note: it is not always beneficial to use Proton; some games run natively on Linux without compatability tools. Check [ProtonDB][3] for Linux supported games and tips on running.*

### NVIDIA GPUs

**Enabling a graphics card**  
Switch between graphics modes with `sudo prime-select <mode>` and reboot. For games to use your graphics card, `prime-select` should be set to `nvidia` or `on-demand`. Show your current graphics mode with `sudo prime-select query`. *Note: exlcusively using a disrete graphics card (`nvidia` option) will use more power than normal.*

**GPU stats**  
To view programs using your GPU as well as power usage and other information, run `nvidia-smi`. If a game is correctly using your GPU, a listing should appear in `nvidia-smi` after it has started running.

### Viewing Logs

Logs will be output to the terminal if Steam is started from the terminal. Run Steam with `snap run steam`; Steam and game-related logs will be displayed in the same window.

### Issues

Check [existing issues](5) for information regarding any issue you may have first. If nothing exists, open a new issue describing your problem [here][6]. Helpful information to include would be your Steam snap and Snapd versions, Proton version(s), system/GPU information, and any relevant logs.
