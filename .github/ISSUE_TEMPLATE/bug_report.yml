      Please make sure your issue is exclusive to the Steam Snap and doesn't occur in the Steam deb. If this is a deb issue, then open an issue in Valve's repository instead: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux. If you don't know or don't use the deb version of Steam, leave this unchecked.
